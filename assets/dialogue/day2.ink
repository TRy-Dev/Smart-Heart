Hi Tim,
\n
Good news! We have managed to start up the mainframe, which means new customers will finally be able to sign up. But the issue with AI seems to be more complex. I'll need you to continue your work from yesterday.
By now you should be well familiar with the system, so I'm hoping you will do as well as you did previously. I'll give you a status update as soon as we have any developments with the issue.
\n
Best Regards,
